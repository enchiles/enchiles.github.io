**Purpose**

This protocol is designed to extract bromine related metabolites from aquatic sponges for reverse phase LCMS analysis.

**Steps**

1. Frozen sponge should be lyophilized to dryness.
2. 100 mg of dry sponge tissue should be weighed and homogenized. This should be done using a 2 mL Safe-Lock Eppendorf tube to which a Yttria Stabilized Zirconia Grinding Media Balls 6.5mm (Product #4039GM-S065) under liquid nitrogen flow in a Retsch CryoMill.(This step can also be done using a mortal and pestle over dry ice using liquid nitrogen.)
3. Add 1 mL of 4:1 (MTBE:MeOH) to the homogenized sponge tissue.
4. Vortex for 10 seconds.
5. Place on a shaker in a cold room at 4 degree C for 10 min.
6. Remove from shaker and add 200 uL of H20.
7. Centrifuge for 4 min.
8. Remove 3 X 200 uL aliquots of MTBE layer and put to separate clean tubes for dry down under air flow.
9. Reconstitute in 500 uL of 1:1 (MeOH:IPA) at a concentration of 50 mg/mL
10. Serial dilution was prepared from the 50 mg/mL solution by taking 100 uL and adding to 900 uL (Meoh:IPA) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL
11. Serial dilution was prepared from the 5 mg/mL solution by taking 200 uL and adding to 800 uL (Meoh:IPA) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL

**Notes**

| Sponge Species     | Sample Weight    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Yellow NJ       | 100.4       |
| *Ianthrella basta*       | 99.8       |
| *Cymbastela*       | 100.9       |
| Dark Red       | 100.6      |   

The samples did not look pulverized after the first round of extraction on the CryoMill so I put them through again. The Red Dark sponge homogenized very well, but the Yellow NJ sponge did not. The other two species were somewhere in the middle. This was a concern because if not sufficiently pulverized the extraction solvent could just rehydrate the sponge and not give sufficient supernatent.

After adding the water, it was difficult to see the phase separation for samples that were not fully pulverized.

The intent was to take 3 x 200 uL aliquots of the MTBE layer, but because of the aforementioned reasons I could only take 2 aliquots from the *Ianthrella* and *Cymbastela*. In the future centrifuging for a longer period make help compact the sponge more and ring out more of the organic solvent.
