**Purpose**

This protocol is designed to extract bromine related metabolites from aquatic sponges for reverse phase LCMS analysis.

**Steps**

1. Frozen sponge should be lyophilized to dryness.
2. 100 mg of dry sponge tissue should be weighed and homogenized. This should be done using a 2 mL Safe-Lock Eppendorf tube to which a scoop of Next Advance Zirconium Oxide Beads 2.0mm (Product #ZROB20) under liquid nitrogen flow in a Retsch CryoMill.(This step can also be done using a mortal and pestle over dry ice using liquid nitrogen.)
3. Add 1 mL of 4:1 (MTBE:MeOH) to the homogenized sponge tissue.
4. Vortex for 10 seconds.
5. Place on a shaker in a cold room at 4 degree C for 10 min.
6. Remove from shaker and add 200 uL of H20.
7. Centrifuge for 10 min.
8. Remove 3 X 200 uL aliquots of MTBE layer and put to separate clean tubes for dry down under air flow.
9. Reconstitute in 500 uL of 1:1 (MeOH:IPA) at a concentration of 50 mg/mL
10. Serial dilution was prepared from the 50 mg/mL solution by taking 100 uL and adding to 900 uL (Meoh:IPA) at a concentration of 5 mg/mL


**Notes**

| Sponge Species     | Sample Weight (mg)   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| *Stylissa flabelliformis*     | 99.8       |
| *Cantenio spongia*       | 102       |
| *Cliona orientalis*       | 100.4       |
| TNJ Orange       | 99.8      |   
| TNJ Yellow   |  101.2 |

To improve on the homogenization attempts the first time, the sponge samples we pre broken up into small pieces.

The samples looked well pulverized after the first round of extraction on the CryoMill, but I ran them twice just to be consistent with the first extraction attempt. In the future I think one round will be sufficient. There was no concern of rehydration due to insufficient homogenization.

After the addition of Water and centrifugation there was an clear phase separation in the eppendorf tubes across all of the samples. This time I increased the centrifugation to 10 minutes. I was able to take 3 x 200 uL aliquots of the MTBE layer from each sample to dry down under air flow. I used one tube for the reconstitution and saved the remaining tube at -80.
