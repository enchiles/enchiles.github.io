I am a Ph.D student in the Su Laboratory and Research Teaching Specialist at the Metabolomics Shared Resource at Rutgers Univeristy. My research focuses on understanding the alterations to metabolic function of scleractinian corals during dissymbiosis resulting from heat stress. In addition, I am interesting in how LCMS based metabolomic appraches can be used to identify coral natural products that may be synthesized for bioprospecting. I adamantly believe that science is strenthened when it is done in a cooperative way. If you're interested in the content of my research, please do not hesitate to connect with me on Twitter @LCMS_Eric or send me an email at [enchiles@cinj.rutgers.edu](mailto:email@domain.com).
